## Abstract

Global challenges—including climate change, ozone depletion, acid rain, population growth, resource scarcity, pollution, and social inequality—are increasingly constraining human development. In response, promoting sustainable development has become a global priority. As the region with the highest concentration of developing countries, Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has experienced significant recent growth. However, its sustainable development process faces serious challenges amidst the global sustainability wave.

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is a critical factor influencing sustainable development in SSA. This research addresses key questions: Does FDI promote or inhibit sustainable development in SSA? Through what channels and pathways does it operate? How does the heterogeneity of FDI and varying host country conditions affect this impact?

Notably, China has become the second-largest source of FDI in SSA after the Netherlands. While SSA urgently needs FDI to foster socio-economic development, it also risks becoming a destination for resource exploitation, pollution transfer, and may face threats to industrial security from foreign monopolies. These concerns have also triggered Western scrutiny of China's rapidly growing investments in the region. Therefore, investigating the impact of FDI on SSA's sustainable development is crucial not only for an objective assessment—including of Chinese investment—but also for advancing global sustainable development goals.

This thesis establishes a research framework based on international investment and sustainable development theories to clarify the mechanisms through which FDI affects a host country's sustainable development. We design a novel indicator system tailored to SSA, assessing sustainability across economic, social, resource, and ecological dimensions. Employing nonlinear fixed-effects panel models, mediation, and moderation analysis, we empirically examine the direct and indirect effects of FDI on sustainable development in SSA. We also investigate the impact of heterogeneous FDI and how effects differ under various host country conditions.

### Main Findings:

1.  **FDI impacts sustainable development directly and indirectly** through transmission mechanisms like industrial structure upgrading and technological effects, and is regulated by host country conditions like institutional quality and financial development.
2.  **Sustainable development in SSA has seen positive progress, though with spatial disparities.** Economic sustainability lags, showing the slowest growth and largest regional gaps.
3.  **The overall impact of FDI on sustainable development in SSA is nonlinear (U-shaped)** and is currently primarily facilitative in most countries. Impacts vary across subsystems:
    *   **U-shaped** for economic and social development.
    *   **Inverted U-shaped** for resource and ecological sustainability.
4.  **Industrial structure and technological effects serve as significant transmission channels.** Improved institutional quality and financial development positively moderate FDI's impact, strengthening its promoting effect.
5.  **The impact varies by FDI type, motive, and origin.** Cross-border M&A FDI has a larger positive effect than greenfield investment; market- and efficiency-seeking FDI is more beneficial than other types; and Chinese FDI exhibits the highest marginal contribution to sustainable development among major investing countries. Effects are also greater in middle-income, non-heavily indebted poor countries (non-HIPCs), and Southeastern African nations compared to their counterparts.

Based on these conclusions, we propose policy recommendations focusing on attracting high-quality FDI, promoting technology transfer and spillovers, leveraging FDI for industrial upgrading, improving institutional quality, innovating financial mechanisms, and implementing differentiated foreign investment policies.

This study contributes to the literature by: (1) designing a tailored sustainable development indicator system for SSA; (2) establishing and testing a nonlinear model of FDI's impact; (3) theoretically and empirically expanding the mechanisms of FDI's impact through transmission and regulatory channels; and (4) providing a comprehensive analysis of FDI heterogeneity and host country conditionality, addressing a gap in existing research.
